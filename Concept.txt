                                      All Concept of Node.js

Initially Javascript only can run on client/browser . But now it can execute on laptop/computer/server etc only
need to insitall software which is knows as node.js .

ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰  What is node.js ?

1. Node.js allows us to run javascript on server(outside browser) .
2. Open Source (Any version of it we can use according to project needs) .
3. Free (don't require any charge for using) .
4. Node.js uses asynchronous programming . (Basically can accept 2 request until first still processing) .


ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰  What can node.js do ?

1. Database/Db operations .
2. File operations .
3. Data processing etc .

Basically now javascript can execute on server , client , computer , laptop  etc due node.js .


ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰  There are two ways we can use/work on node.js .

1. Line by Line(Repl)
2. File(To run code of file just have to give command as node filename);

ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰  Coding 
Command to run node on system is node
Common important commands
ðŸ‘‰ .break    Sometimes you get stuck, this gets you out
ðŸ‘‰ .clear    Alias for .break
ðŸ‘‰ .editor   Enter editor mode
ðŸ‘‰ .exit     Exit the REPL
ðŸ‘‰ .help     Print this help message
ðŸ‘‰ .load     Load JS from a file into the REPL session
ðŸ‘‰ .save     Save all evaluated commands in this REPL session to a file


ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰  What are Modules?

Modules simply are Libraries basically already written code(lots of people write lots of code
which we have to use in our poject according to project need).
we can also create our own module and can use it in our own project by import then.
Modules examples such as http, os, fs, express, nodemon, url etc.


ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰  How we can use/import module ?

we can import using require function such as const variable = require('Modulename') this is how we 
we can use any module.

ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ Here is simple code to create a server using http module of node.js 
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer((req , resp)=>{
    //request processing --> req
    //for writing response --> resp
    resp.write("<h1>Create a file using js extension and run it </h1>");
    resp.write("<p> This is how we can create a localhost server </p>");
    resp.end("That's all");
});

server.listen(3000 , ()=>{console.log("Server is running on port ðŸ‘‰ 3000 ")});


ðŸ‘‰ Is time to create own module and use it let's understand it .
1. Simple create a file name as createmodule.js here how we can create a module
   const findsum = (a , b ,c) => {   
   return (a + b + c);
   }

  module.exports = findsum;  //this is how we can export it and use where we want to use it.

2. Create another file name as usemodule.js and here is simple code which uses our declared module.
  const sum = require("./createmodule"); //Here we import our own module 
  const Result = sum(12 , 3 ,1);
  console.log( "Sum is here " + Result );
